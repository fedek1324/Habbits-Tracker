When using localhost with client components on mobile 
I see when habbit appear on screen

To run on local network on mobile use npm run dev off vpn 
and visit http://192.168.1.137:3000/

                "border rounded-lg " +
                "px-4 py-2 focus:outline-none " +
                "focus:ring-2" +
                (countError
                  ? "border-red-500 focus:ring-red-300"
                  : "border-gray-300 focus:ring-blue-400")
                  Seems like default does not set. Why?
